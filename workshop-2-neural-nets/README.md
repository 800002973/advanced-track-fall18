### ACM AI Advanced Track Workshop 2: Building a 2 Layer Neural Network

This is the coding portion of ACM AI's advanced track workshop #2 for winter quarter 2018. Slides for the workshop can be found [here](TODO link it)

### Usage

The only dependencies are Python 3 and numpy. To make sure you have a suitable machine learning development environment setup, see our instructions [here](https://github.com/uclaacmai/advanced-track-fall18/blob/master/README.md).

The file TwoLayerNet.py contains a numpy-only implementation of a vectorized two-layer neural network. The file TwoLayerRun.py is the runner class for the network, and runs it on the MNIST dataset. A basic run with no hyperparameter tuning, dropout, momentum, etc results in a 93% accuracy.

To run a test, simply run `python3 TwoLayerNet.py`.
